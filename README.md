# Project 3: Getaway Guru

## Description
Have you used apps like TripAdivsor and Trivago? They work exceptionally well, but do they help you truly get the most out of your Travel destinations?
I bring you the all-in-one app: Getaway Guru.
Getaway Guru helps you plan your destination from start to finish. Select your desired city, set a budget, check the weather, see events, local restaurants and popular sights, all under a single app. No need to download a bunch of new apps for the sake of a single trip. You’ll have everything you need for your next trip with Getaway Guru.
