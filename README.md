# Project 3: Getaway Guru

## Elevator Pitch
Have you used apps like TripAdivsor and Trivago? They work exceptionally well, but do they help you truly get the most out of your Travel destinations?
I bring you the all-in-one app: Getaway Guru.
Getaway Guru helps you plan your destination from start to finish. Select your desired city, set a budget, check the weather, see events, local restaurants and popular sights, all under a single app. No need to download a bunch of new apps for the sake of a single trip. You’ll have everything you need for your next trip with Getaway Guru. 


## User Story
As a busy traveler, I want to expertly plan my next trip efficiently in a single app. 
I want to know all the popular sights, restaurants, hotels, etc; and be able to budget my trip accordingly. 

## Concept
This is a full stack MERN application. Then used passport strategy for authentication and mongoDB/Atlas to save their information. Users will be able to choose a destination and check the weather forecast of it and search for attractions around the city to visit.
